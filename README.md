# ViGEm null gamepad

## Why does this exist?
For setting controller one to a virtual device, so that poor people like me can play co-op with one player on keyboard and mouse and other players using controllers.

## Building.
Use cmake to generate solution files for use by the Visual Studio amd64 compiler. If this doesn't apply you'll need to rebuild ViGEmClient for your architecture and overwrite the files in the libs folder with what is spat out.  
If you can, you should just download the release binary for ease of use.
